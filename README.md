These files are a collection point for major projects I have worked on both in an outside of classes. 

Pandemic:
- Pandemic ( a themed version of the classic arcade game Asteroids) allows the user to use the up, right and left keys to move a needle (the spaceship in the original game) to spread vaccine particles and destroy viruses. If the needle is hit by a virus, it is destroyed and the user loses a life. The goal is to survive, advance levels and get the highest score.
- Completed Fall 2020
